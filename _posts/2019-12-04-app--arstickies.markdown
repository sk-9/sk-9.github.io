#### Introduction

AR sticky notes that only you can see.

Create freely, freely place, lock actual scenes, and restore content based on location and scene.

You can place virtual notes in a real scene, save scene information while saving them, and the next time you can restore a previously created note in the same scene in the same place.

This app does not support iCloud sync for the time being, I don't think this technology is suitable for this app's scenario. If my assumption is wrong, please leave your suggestion and I will add this feature.
