#### Introduction
It is kind of to-do-list app .But this is more simple than that.

Y.T.T means "Yesterday","Today" and "Tomorrow", so you only need care about very few things. Or we can say you just take yesterday's items as reference, and take more time think about what we need to do today. If you like you can also make a plan about tomorrow's work. And that's all.

My target is that making a app easy to use, and match people's habit, just like you draw or write on a paper with a pencil.
